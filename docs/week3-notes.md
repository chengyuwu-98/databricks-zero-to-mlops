## Appendix

#### Readings/Media
* [AWS App Runner Containerized Flask](https://github.com/noahgift/fastapi)


#### Discussions
* Why are containers an ideal mechanism for Continuous Delivery?

#### Assignments (Demo)
* Run an MLflow Project on Databricks using an Azure Open Dataset
* Deploy a containerized FastAPI microservice to AWS App Runner.  Alternatively, use a similar PaaS using Continuous Delivery via a Container Registry.
