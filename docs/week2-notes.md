#### Lab

* [MLFlow Project Best Practices-End to End Fake News Pipeline](https://github.com/noahgift/mlflow-project-best-practices)

#### Discussions

* How could experiment tracking increase productivity in a Data Science team?
* Why use automated, parallel hyperparameter tuning with MLFlow?

#### Assignments (Demo)

* Using an Azure Open Dataset, perform several MLflow tracking experiments and identify the best runs.
* Using the [MLFlow Quickstart ML Notebook](https://github.com/FourthBrain/databricks-zero-to-mlops/blob/main/src/week2-mlflow/ML%20Quickstart:%20Model%20Training.py), experiment with Hyperparameter algorithms and parallelization (i.e 2 vs 8). 
* Perform an AutoML Experiment either on your own dataset or a built in dataset.  After you find the best model check in this notebook into your Repo. 
* Setup your own end to end Ingest to AutoML to Endpoint to Script and Test it in Github Actions.  Example project here: https://github.com/noahgift/mlflow-project-best-practices
* Deploy a containerized application to a Cloud Provider or Local Datacenter.
